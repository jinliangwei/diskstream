  abstract = {{Current systems for graph computation require a distributed computing
	cluster to handle very large real-world problems, such as analysis
	on social networks or the web graph. While distributed computational
	resources have become more accessible, developing distributed graph
	algorithms still remains challenging, especially to non-experts.
	
	In this work, we present GraphChi, a disk-based system for computing
	efficiently on graphs with billions of edges. By using a well-known
	method to break large graphs into small parts, and a novel parallel
	sliding windows method, GraphChi is able to execute several advanced
	data mining, graph mining, and machine learning algorithms on very
	large graphs, using just a single consumer-level computer. We further
	extend GraphChi to support graphs that evolve over time, and demonstrate
	that, on a single computer, GraphChi can process over one hundred
	thousand graph updates per second, while simultaneously performing
	computation. We show, through experiments and theoretical analysis,
	that GraphChi performs well on both SSDs and rotational hard drives.
	
	By repeating experiments reported for existing distributed systems,
	we show that, with only fraction of the resources, GraphChi can solve
	the same problems in very reasonable time. Our work makes large-scale
	graph computation available to anyone with a modern PC.}},
